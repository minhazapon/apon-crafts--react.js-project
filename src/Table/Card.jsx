Quilling: Quilling involves rolling and shaping narrow strips of paper to create intricate designs. These designs can be used to embellish cards, creating beautiful and detailed patterns.
Decoupage: Decoupage is the art of decorating objects by gluing colored paper cutouts onto them. In card making, decoupage can be used to add depth and texture to designs by layering paper cutouts in creative ways.
Embossing and Die-Cutting: Embossing involves creating raised designs on paper by pressing it between two dies, while die-cutting involves cutting out shapes from paper using a die-cutting machine. These techniques can be used to add intricate patterns and designs to cards.
Handmade Envelopes: Handmade envelopes can add a personal touch to your card crafts. You can create custom envelopes using decorative paper and templates, or even repurpose materials like old maps or book pages for a unique look.
